                    <p>
                        Argentina won their first major title in 28 years on Saturday when an Angel Di Maria goal gave
                        them a 1-0 win over Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America crown.<br>Argentina's
                        victory was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked up his first
                        title in a blue-and-white shirt after more than a decade of club and individual honours.

                        absorbing Copa America clash on Sunday.<br>
                        Peru, who reached the final of the last Copa America
                        but had won just two of their 12 games
                        since, got off to a good start in Goiania when they took the lead after 17 minutes when Sergio
                        Pena hammered home a Yoshimar Yotun shot that had come back off the post. <br>
                        The goal ended Colombia's run of seven Copa America games without conceding but they grabbed a
                        deserved equaliser eight minutes into the second half when Miguel Borja was brought down in the
                        box as he tried to go round keeper Pedro Gallese.</p>
